Solution to 99 Problems in Python

This is a repo for learning Python, by solving 99 classical computing problems using the language ans std lib - the original original 99-problems list (in Scala) is avaliable here: http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

The main idea here is that by solving these problems we should have a pretty good understanding and handling of the language - this same approach may be used with any prog language - C, C++, Java, Scala, Ruby, Julia, Rust, etc, so I use it as a tool for learning/perfecting prog lang knowledge

**NOTES**:

* The focus of this repo is to perfect my knowledge of Python (and help others on the way) - there's no focus in making the faster/shorter/best-in-any-aspect solution; the focus here is **readability**; eventually, solutions using Python's std lib shall be included, but only if they make the code simpler and more readable, not including arcanish solutions

* The focus of the original Scala/Lisp's 99 problems was to train in the functional paradigm. This is not the focus in this repo, we shall use the pythonic way, not necessarily the functional way.
