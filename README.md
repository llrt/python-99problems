Solution to 99 Problems in Python

This is a repo for learning Python, by solving 99 classical computing problems using the language ans std lib - the original original 99-problems list (in Scala) is avaliable here: http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

The idea is that by solving these problems you shall have a pretty good understanding and handling of the language - this same approach may be used with any prog language - C, C++, Java, Scala, Ruby, Julia, Rust, etc, so I use it as a tool for learning/perfecting prog lang knowledge
